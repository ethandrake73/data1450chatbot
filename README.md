DATA1450 Chatbot

This chatbot project was developed under the guidance of Shekhar Pradhan in DATA1450 at Brown University in the spring of 2024. 

The project goal was to create a chatbot that answers questions about a complex energy regulatory proceeding.
In specific, the proceeding that we looked at was the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) docket 20-80 a.k.a. “The Future of Gas”. This proceeding was an investigation into the future of gas distribution system & gas utilities that spanned 3.5 years from June 2020 to December 2023, and provided the state of Massachusetts with a roadmap for phasing out gas as a means for meeting decarbonization goals.

This chatbot uses a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system alongside OpenAI's GPT 3.5 model to accurately query and summarize the proceedings and its conclusions. The chatbot also includes a web search tool to allow users to ask more recent questions about what has happened with the ruling since the proceedings concluded.

We believe that a chatbot that can interact with and query the large docket will be useful under-resourced policy advocates, commission staff, and political science research. The chatbot and RAG system is a test case for using a similar system for future state level energy proceedings.
